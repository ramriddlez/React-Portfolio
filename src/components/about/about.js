                <p className='a-sub'>
                    I come from an INTENSIVE data analytical financial background. I have spent the better part of my twenties in capital markets, hedge funds, and entrepreneurship.

                <p className='a-desc'>
                    Now I wish to use my analytical, solutions-oriented decision making skills within Software Development. Diving deep into the University of Toronto's coding bootcamp, I am well equipped with the skills needed to bring quality-code to your company.

                    I enjoy self-improvement via reading, learning and weight training! I love mental growth done by EQ training and meditation! This allows for me to be the captain of my ship and lead my people! I am the father to two dogs; a purebred Golden Retriever named Duke, and Niko, a purebred maltese! &#128062; &#128062; &#128151;
